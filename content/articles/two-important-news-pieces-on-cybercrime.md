1.  The FBI is executing warrants against the Wiki-leaks
    supporters.I had long suspected that most of these guys were
    not as tricky (sophisticated) as they thought they
    were. [details](http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2011/01/27/107589/fbi-serves-40-warrants-in-search.html)
2.  Another article on government picking at your electronic
    data. Who gets picked for this is a crapshoot. The problem is
    not that they are friending people on facebook to snoop but
    that there are too many illegal acts they can investigate. It
    is time to go after rogue prosecutors, people always go after
    the cop. We need to change direction at the
    top. [overciminalization](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/gw-schulz/when-can-cops-gain-access_b_815211.html)
