# Renowned Researcher and GC CompSci EO Haralick vists undergrads

CUNY Graduate Center Executive Officer and Distinguished Professor
Robert Haralick came to visit the Computer Science club at John Jay
last Thursday.  His nominal topic was graduate school applications.
More than 40 students attended the talk which was followed by lively
question and answer session.  Haralick encouraged students to spend
enough time struggling with their computer science homework.

A world renowned research in pattern recognition and image analysis, 
Haralick implored students, "Every day I struggle with new problems.
The key is not giving up too soon.  You are smarter than you think.
Keep pressing on."
