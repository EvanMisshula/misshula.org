# Introduction<a id="sec-2" name="sec-2"></a>

Welcome to Advanced Data Structures, Fall 2011. From MIT Open
Courseware:

> Data structures play a central role in modern computer science. You
> interact with data structures even more often than with algorithms
> (think Google, your mail server, and even your network routers). In
> addition, data structures are essential building blocks in obtaining
> efficient algorithms. This course covers major results in data
> structures:

This is the most important class in terms of getting a job as a
programmer or developer after school.  A substantial portion of any
"coding interview" will cover topics from this class. This will allow
you to survive the first round of an interview and imporess them with
your other knowledge. The class will be a success if some of these
tools make the rest of your career (research, government or
industrial) more productive and enjoyable.The syllabus will be updated
as the course progresses.  The schedule is not currently set and will
be starting to be updated soon. You are welcome (and encouraged) to
make your own recordings of the lectures.

# Computers in the classroom<a id="sec-4" name="sec-4"></a>

This is a hands on class.  You will be in front of a computer during
class throughout the semester.  Please feel free to use the computer
to take notes or use the class Etherpad to discuss the course
material, but do **not** use the computers for non-class related topics.

# What is the goal of the class?<a id="sec-5" name="sec-5"></a>

-   The course goal is for students to learn how to design, write, and
    analyze C/C++ programs use structured data to perform complex
    tasks. These tasks are typical of large software projects.

-   If the class is successful students will be able to use general
    principles for data representation & manipulation.  They will write
    efficient, maintainable and modular code.

-   If the class is successful students will be able to analyze abstract
    data types such as vectors, lists, deques, trees, etc.

-   If the class is successful students will be able to use techniques
    such containers, adaptors, accessing data through interface,
    iterators and tail-recursion.

-   If the class is successful students will be able to analyze
    algorithms using Big-0 notation.

# What will be covered?<a id="sec-6" name="sec-6"></a>

All of the technologies have been chosen to be readily available and
likely to be around for many years to come.  You will gain experience
with the following (do not worry if you have not heard of some or all
of these).  Because this is a one semester class, we will not be able
to go into depth on these topics, but this should provide the
foundation for you to learn more when you need or want to.

Note: this is not the order that we will cover the material and we
might not get to all of these in class.

1.  Sructs and classes
2.  Overload operators
3.  Class templates
4.  Abstract data types
5.  Pointers and dynamic arrays
6.  Implementing an array class
7.  Methods for making data structures
8.  Stacks and queues
9.  Hash tables
10. Priority queues
11. Tree structures
12. Heaps
13. Recursion and Sorting
14. Sorting
15. Binary Search Trees and Graphs

# Grades<a id="sec-7" name="sec-7"></a>

There will be weekly homework. The problems will be difficult. Successful
completion of all homework should guarantee a grade of 'A'.  In addition 
there will a midterm and final exam in case students are struggling. Be warned,
this is a demanding class.

> The general rule of thumb regarding college studying is, and has been
> for a long time, that for each class, students should spend
> approximately 2-3 of study time for each hour that they spend in
> class. Many students carry a course load of 15 credits, or
> approximately 15 hours of class time each week.

<http://bit.ly/1wwrUR1>

If students are spending considerablely more than 7.5 hours per week
on the homework, they are advised to speak with the instructor and 
adjustments will be made.  If you put int the time, there is no reason 
not to get an outstanding mark.  Do not try to game the system by not 
doing the homework and making it up on the exams.  That strategy has not 
been successful yet.

# ATTENDANCE POLICY<a id="sec-8" name="sec-8"></a>

Students enrolled in this course are required to attend all lecture,
recitation and laboratory sessions of the section for which they
registered. (During summer session, two weeks of classes are covered
each calendar week.) Excessive absences (defined above) will result in
a reduction in the grade. Attendance is taken solely from roll sheets
circulated at the beginning and/or end of each session. Lateness or
early departure (resulting in missing no more than 15 minutes of a
session) counts as 1⁄2 absence. Students missing more than 15 minutes
of a session will be counted as absent. If the college is officially
closed, thereby canceling all classes, an announcement will be found
on 237-8000, and broadcast on AM stations WINS (1010), WOR (710), WCBS
(880), WADD (1280), WMCA (570), WLIB (1190), and WFAS (1230), as well
as FM stations WCBS (101.1) and WBLS (107.5). If a class will be
cancelled for extraordinary circumstances, the instructor will email
an announcement to the preferred email of enrolled students as soon as
practicable. This has not happened in recent memory.

# ACTIVE COLLEGE E-MAIL<a id="sec-9" name="sec-9"></a>

Students are expected to maintain active and accessible college email
and Blackboard accounts. Blackboard will be used to send emails and
may be used to post announcements, handouts, additional study
materials, text supplements, grades, etc. Use the CUNY Portal Login
page help features for a forgotten username or password, or contact
DoIT, 212-237-8200 for other help. Verify your CUNY email address is
correctly listed on Blackboard and keep the mailbox from filling up
and refusing delivery, because you will be responsible for the
contents of any email sent to that account. 

When emailing instructors for this course, start the email’s subject
line with the course and section number (e.g., CSCI 372-01) followed
by a brief description. Include your full name in the body of every
email. Emails that do not contain these descriptive details may be
considered spam, and remain unopened and unanswered. Students are
expected to check email regularly.

# TUTORING<a id="sec-10" name="sec-10"></a>

Although a considerable amount of remediation is done during the
course, when necessary students are encouraged to attend&#x2013; on a first
come, first served basis—free tutoring offered to students requesting
such help. Scheduled weekly or biweekly appointments are
encouraged. “Crash” sessions immediately before an exam are
discouraged. A student who fails an exam or homework (less than 60.00%) is
required to sign into and attend at least one hour of tutoring weekly
until the next exam. An additional hour of tutoring is required for
every seven days, or part thereof, homework is past due. (The homework
must still be completed.) Failure to sign in and attend required
tutoring and provide attendance documentation counts as a recitation
absence per occurrence. Attendance at tutoring is automatically
forwarded to the instructor by the Math and Science Resource
Center.

# ADA STATEMENT: STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES<a id="sec-11" name="sec-11"></a>

Qualified students with disabilities will be provided reasonable
academic accommodations if determined appropriate by the Office of
Accessibility Services (OAS), 212- 237-8031, located in room
L.66.00. Prior to granting disability accommodations, verification of
a student’s eligibility must be timely received from OAS by the math
department chairman, Professor Douglas Salane (dsalane@jjay.cuny.edu),
and the instructor, from the OAS. It is the student’s responsibility
to initiate contact with the OAS and to follow the established
procedures for having the accommodation notice sent to both the course
coordinator and the instructor.

# ACADEMIC INTEGRITY:<a id="sec-12" name="sec-12"></a>

Students who succeed in this course and graduate with a degree in
Computer Science and Information Security may be hired by government
or private agencies to analyze evidence and testify in a court of law,
placing in jeopardy another person’s reputation and/or
liberty. Dishonesty of any kind cannot and will not be
tolerated. Students are expected to become thoroughly aware of the
“John Jay College Policy on Academic Integrity” (and other college
policies), available on the college’s Web site. Sanctions to the
extent permitted by the policy will be imposed and any written
material submitted may be transmitted by the instructor to
Turnitin.com (or equivalent service) to help analyze its
originality. See the Undergraduate Bulletin for the College’s Policy
on Plagiarism and Cheating, which will be strictly
enforced. Plagiarism includes copying ASA or homework answers from
others. You are required to do your own work to avoid severe grade and
disciplinary penalties. The College subscribes to Turnitin.com and
Blackboard has a similar module called SafeAssign. Any written
assignments submitted may be subject to evaluation by these or similar
programs.
