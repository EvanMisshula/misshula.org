# Course description

In this course, students will understand the fundamental principles of
database management systems (DBMS).  Through projects, they will gain
valuable skills on how to design scalable databases using
entity-relationship diagrams.  They will learn how to extract useful
information from the database by discovering patterns within the
underlying data.  Finally, they will develop database analyst skills
using SQL, and use this to implement several real-life database
applications.  Students will gain hands-on experience with a modern
DBMS platform (MySQL) and (Postgres) by completing several exercises.
Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to
design and organize a database to manage their application data, and
be able to design queries to extract useful information from a
database.

# Learning outcomes

Your success is our primary reason for being here. The student will be
able to do the following at the end of the course:

1.  Understand fundamental database concepts, such as relational model,
    entity-relationship diagrams, file storage, and indexing.
2.  Interact with a database management system, using the SQL language.
3.  Identify interesting patterns in large datasets, using the concepts
    of classification, association rules, and clustering.
4.  Design and implement a client-defined database, using the MySQL and
    Postgres database management system.

# Course pre-requisites or co-requisites

Prerequisite(s): ENG 102/201, CSCI 373

# Requirements / course policies

-   Attendance: Students are expected to attend and participate in
    all classes.  Attendance is taken at the beginning of each
    class.  Any absence is excusable in advance.  Please notify
    the instructor in writing and in advance of any anticipated
    absence whenever possible. The material will be easier to
    absorb if you are here. Class participation will be considered
    in your final grade.
-   Grading policy: Homework and final project should be finished
    and turned in on time. However, the grade book will remain open in
    perpetuity.  Resubmissions are encouraged.  I care that you learn
    this material not how fast you learn it.  If you have not
    resubmitted or written to me about an assignment two weeks
    after you were asked to submit, your last grade will become
    your final grade.
-   Academic honesty: Discussions on course materials, homework
    questions and programming projects are **encouraged**. It is
    permissible to get help on debugging and to make use of public
    accessible programming libraries for your programming
    assignments. However, you should **NOT ASK ANY OTHER PERSON TO
    WRITE CODE FOR YOU**. On your project report, you should specify
    from whom you received help and cite the references and
    software used. All homework solutions, code and report for
    programming projects should be finished individually.
-   Cheating: If you submit someone else's work as your own, I will fail
    you the first time.

# Computers in the classroom

This is a hands on class.  You will be in front of a computer during
class throughout the semester.  Please feel free to use the computer
to take notes or use the class Etherpad to discuss the course
material, but do **not** use the computers for non-class related topics.

# Grades

There will be weekly homework. The problems will be difficult. Successful
completion of all homework should guarantee a grade of 'A'.  In addition 
there will a midterm and final exam in case students are struggling. Be warned,
this is a demanding class.

> The general rule of thumb regarding college studying is, and has been
> for a long time, that for each class, students should spend
> approximately 2-3 of study time for each hour that they spend in
> class. Many students carry a course load of 15 credits, or
> approximately 15 hours of class time each week.

<http://bit.ly/1wwrUR1>

If students are spending considerablely more than 7.5 hours per week
on the homework, they are advised to speak with the instructor and 
adjustments will be made.  If you put int the time, there is no reason 
not to get an outstanding mark.  Do not try to game the system by not 
doing the homework and making it up on the exams.  That strategy has not 
been successful yet.

# Attendance policy

Students enrolled in this course are required to attend all lecture,
recitation and laboratory sessions of the section for which they
registered. (During summer session, two weeks of classes are covered
each calendar week.) Excessive absences (defined above) will result in
a reduction in the grade. Attendance is taken solely from roll sheets
circulated at the beginning and/or end of each session. Lateness or
early departure (resulting in missing no more than 15 minutes of a
session) counts as 1⁄2 absence. Students missing more than 15 minutes
of a session will be counted as absent. If the college is officially
closed, thereby canceling all classes, an announcement will be found
on 237-8000, and broadcast on AM stations WINS (1010), WOR (710), WCBS
(880), WADD (1280), WMCA (570), WLIB (1190), and WFAS (1230), as well
as FM stations WCBS (101.1) and WBLS (107.5). If a class will be
cancelled for extraordinary circumstances, the instructor will email
an announcement to the preferred email of enrolled students as soon as
practicable. This has not happened in recent memory.

# Active college e-mail

Students are expected to maintain active and accessible college email
and Blackboard accounts. Blackboard will be used to send emails and
may be used to post announcements, handouts, additional study
materials, text supplements, grades, etc. Use the CUNY Portal Login
page help features for a forgotten username or password, or contact
DoIT, 212-237-8200 for other help. Verify your CUNY email address is
correctly listed on Blackboard and keep the mailbox from filling up
and refusing delivery, because you will be responsible for the
contents of any email sent to that account. 

When emailing instructors for this course, start the email’s subject
line with the course and section number (e.g., CSCI 362-01) followed
by a brief description. Include your full name in the body of every
email. Emails that do not contain these descriptive details may be
considered spam, and remain unopened and unanswered. Students are
expected to check email regularly.

# ADA Statement: students with disabilities

qualified students with disabilities will be provided reasonable
academic accommodations if determined appropriate by the Office of
Accessibility Services (OAS), 212- 237-8031, located in room
L.66.00. Prior to granting disability accommodations, verification of
a student’s eligibility must be timely received from OAS by the math
department chairman, Professor Douglas Salane (dsalane@jjay.cuny.edu),
and the instructor, from the OAS. It is the student’s responsibility
to initiate contact with the OAS and to follow the established
procedures for having the accommodation notice sent to both the course
coordinator and the instructor.

# Academic integrity:

Students who succeed in this course and graduate with a degree in
Computer Science and Information Security may be hired by government
or private agencies to analyze evidence and testify in a court of law,
placing in jeopardy another person’s reputation and/or
liberty. Dishonesty of any kind cannot and will not be
tolerated. Students are expected to become thoroughly aware of the
“John Jay College Policy on Academic Integrity” (and other college
policies), available on the college’s Web site. Sanctions to the
extent permitted by the policy will be imposed and any written
material submitted may be transmitted by the instructor to
Turnitin.com (or equivalent service) to help analyze its
originality. See the Undergraduate Bulletin for the College’s Policy
on Plagiarism and Cheating, which will be strictly
enforced. Plagiarism includes copying ASA or homework answers from
others. You are required to do your own work to avoid severe grade and
disciplinary penalties. The College subscribes to Turnitin.com and
Blackboard has a similar module called SafeAssign. Any written
assignments submitted may be subject to evaluation by these or similar
programs.

# College wide policies for undergraduate courses

A. Incomplete Grade Policy 

An Incomplete Grade may be given only to those students who would pass
the course if they were able to satisfactorily complete the course
requirements. It is within the discretion of the faculty member as to
whether or not to give the grade of Incomplete.

B.        Extra Work During the Semester

Any extra credit coursework opportunities during the semester for a
student to improve his or her grade must be made available to students
at the same time. Furthermore, there is no obligation on the part of
any instructor to offer extra credit work in any course. The term
“extra credit work” refers to optional work that may be assigned by
the instructor to all students in addition to the required work for
the course that the student must complete. It is distinguished from
substitute assignments or substitute work that may be assigned by the
instructor to individual students, such as make-up assignments to
accommodate emergencies or to accommodate the special circumstances of
individual students.

C.        Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Policies  

“Qualified students with disabilities will be provided reasonable
academic accommodations if determined eligible by the Office of
Accessibility Services (OAS).  Prior to granting disability
accommodations in this course, the instructor must receive written
verification of a student’s eligibility from the OAS which is located
at L66 in the new building (212-237-8031).  It is the student’s
responsibility to initiate contact with the office and to follow the
established procedures for having the accommodation notice sent to
the instructor.” 

# Statement of the College Policy on Plagiarism

Plagiarism is the presentation of someone else‘s ideas, words, or
artistic, scientific, or technical work as one‘s own creation.  Using
the ideas or work of another is permissible only when the original
author is identified.  Paraphrasing and summarizing, as well as direct
quotations require citations to the original source.  Plagiarism may
be intentional or unintentional. Lack of dishonest intent does not
necessarily absolve a student of responsibility for plagiarism.  It is
the student’s responsibility to recognize the difference between
statements that are common knowledge (which do not require
documentation) and restatements of the ideas of others.  Paraphrase,
summary, and direct quotation are acceptable forms of restatement, as
long as the source is cited.  Students who are unsure how and when to
provide documentation are advised to consult with their instructors.
The Library has free guides designed to help students with problems of
documentation. (John Jay College of Criminal Justice Undergraduate
Bulletin, <http://www.jjay.cuny.edu/academics/654.php> , see Chapter IV
