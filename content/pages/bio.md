I am a [GC Digital Fellow](https://digitalfellows.commons.gc.cuny.edu) and sixth year PhD student in [Criminal
Justice](http://gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Doctoral-Programs/Criminal-Justice) at the [CUNY Graduate Center](http://gc.cuny.edu/Home).  I work part-time as a data
scientist at the John Jay [Research and Evaluation Center](http://johnjayrec.nyc/2014/06/15/cv2014_maps/) where we
evaluate anti-violence programs. I serve as a CUNY John Jay
